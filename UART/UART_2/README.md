# STM32 UART Command Receiver

This STM32 project demonstrates how to use UART (USART2) to receive a 2-character command (`AR`) and respond with `ok` using STM32 HAL drivers.

## üöÄ Features

- UART communication using `HAL_UART_Receive` and `HAL_UART_Transmit`
- String comparison to detect a specific command (`AR`)
- Sends back a predefined response (`ok`)
- Blocking mode UART with `HAL_MAX_DELAY`

## üì¶ Files

- `main.c`: Main application logic
- `stm32fxxx_hal_msp.c`: HAL initialization code (generated by STM32CubeMX)
- `stm32fxxx_it.c`: Interrupt handlers (optional for this project)
- `usart.c`: USART2 initialization (called in `main.c`)
- `gpio.c`: GPIO initialization (for LED or button if needed)

## üîß Hardware Requirements

- STM32 development board (e.g., Nucleo-F401RE, STM32F4 Discovery, etc.)
- USB to Serial converter or onboard ST-Link Virtual COM port
- Serial terminal (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term, or Arduino Serial Monitor)

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Requirements

- STM32CubeMX (to generate boilerplate code)
- STM32CubeIDE or Keil MDK (for compiling and flashing)
- HAL drivers (generated by CubeMX)

## üß™ How It Works

1. Initializes UART2 at 115200 baud.
2. Waits to receive 2 characters.
3. If the received string is `AR`, it replies with:
ok\r\n


### üîÅ Loop Logic

```c
uint8_t rxBuffer[3] = {0};
uint8_t txBuffer[] = "\nok\r\n";

while (1)
{
 if (HAL_UART_Receive(&huart2, rxBuffer, 2, HAL_MAX_DELAY) == HAL_OK)
 {
     rxBuffer[2] = '\0'; // Null-terminate
     if (strcmp((char*)rxBuffer, "AR") == 0)
     {
         HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, txBuffer, strlen((char*)txBuffer), HAL_MAX_DELAY);
     }
 }
}
